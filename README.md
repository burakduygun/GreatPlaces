# Great Places App
Great Places is a mobile application that allows users to save and easily access places they visit or like during their travels. Users can take photos of places they enjoy and add location information. These details are managed locally on the device using the SQLite database. The home screen displays a list of users' favorite places, and by tapping each item, users can access a detailed page with more information about the selected place.
